# Berkeley-Book-Search-Engine



## Description


In this project, our focus extended beyond basic server setup and routing. We delved into more advanced aspects of backend development, exploring queries, typeDefs, resolvers, mutations, JWT decoding, and the utilization of resolvers within a context. Additionally, we tackled the integration of these elements to create a seamless connection between the server and the UI, empowering us to build a functional application capable of managing and tracking notes across multiple devices.

Absolutely, in addition to the comprehensive backend knowledge, this project also provided an understanding of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack's architecture. We utilized Express.js for the backend server, connected it to a MongoDB database, and integrated the frontend using React, thereby covering the entire MERN stack to develop a full-stack application for note tracking.
